    "### About this workshop/repository\n",
    "The notebooks in this repo will be presented live as a workshop at the Transform 2021 conference (April 2021). To participate you can use binder and the code repo to have an interactive python environment. The material is aimed at being accessible to all skill levels. The goal is to present some general principles and techniques of project organization and design that will allow for increasing project size, colloboration, and complexity over time (applied to data science). The techniques that will be presented are not tied to any commercial software or programming language (even though the examples used will be in Python). "

    "We've all seen the presentations about how at x large company or worldwide 95%, 98%, 9x% of data science projects fail. The surprise in the figures is often the so many POCs show promising results early on, often more the 50% of efforts in these presentations almost never less than 20% show promise from the presentations I've seen like this. Often these figures are cited at conferences full of managers, executives, or scientists (other than data scientists). These presentations often include reasons for this, but, in my experience, the observations are shallow or too high level to really glean anything useful about what is driving the high failure rates of data science projects. So let's get real, what really causes promising data science projects to never reach their potential?"

There are genuinely trade-offs and tension between the desire to move fast and the drive to make a quality program, but there are many times where this trade-off masks the true choice which is too apply good design principles or to ignore them. The insane thing about this is that good design practices rarely takes more time or effort initially than bad ones (there are exceptions), but the long term impact on technical debt, agility, and time spent on a project can be massive. So what is good design in code and data science projects? There's an acronym for it proposed by Robert C Martin: SOLID\n",

At a small scale a function should do one and only one thing, if you have functions over 20 lines or so, you probably have functions doing too many things at once (break them up!). It also relates to code files (often called modules). Code files should only have resposibility over one area of your project at a time and should serve the needs of one customer, stakeholder, actor, etc. You should never have a code file extending beyond 300 lines or so (except in really rare carefully thought out circumstances) and if you do, you are probably violating this principle in some way.
